VichGeographicalBundle
======================

The VichGeographicalBundle provides automatic geographic coordinate querying for ORM 
entities and ODM documents. The bundle also provides functionality for rendering 
of JavaScript maps for these entities in your Symfony2 project using annotations. 
It also allows for object oriented JavaScript maps to be rendered without 
using any of the coordinate querying features. The bundle uses Google maps by 
default, but other maps are always being integrated and you can always write your 
own map renderer.
